                BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; 
                lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as 
                the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band 
                formed in 2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. 
                The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga,
                 J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and 
                 co-produces the majority of their material. Originally a 
                 hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate 
                 a wide range of genres, while their lyricism has focused on 
                 subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth 
                 and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, 
                 and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent 
                 work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychological concepts,
                and includes an alternate universe storyline.
